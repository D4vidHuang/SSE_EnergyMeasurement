## Energy Measurement Branches

We conducted energy consumption measurements for two browsers across three different operating systems. To maintain data integrity and avoid conflicts, each OS-specific dataset and scripts reside in their dedicated branches as listed below:

### 🐧 Linux Branch
- **Branch Link**: [linux_test](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/linux_test)
- **Description**: Contains scripts and analysis specifically designed to measure browser energy consumption on Linux-based operating systems.

### 🍎 macOS Branch
- **Branch Link**: [macos](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/macos)
- **Description**: Contains scripts, datasets, and analysis focused on browser energy measurement conducted on the macOS platform.

### 🪟 Windows Branch
- **Branch Link**: [windows](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/windows)
- **Description**: Provides Windows-specific automation scripts, data, and detailed analysis for browser energy consumption studies.

### 📂 Branch Files Overview

**🪟 Windows Branch (`windows`):**
- `benchmark_test.ps1`: PowerShell script designed to automate browser benchmarking and energy measurement specifically for Windows systems.
