## Energy Measurement Branches

We conducted energy consumption measurements for two browsers across three different operating systems. To maintain data integrity and avoid conflicts, each OS-specific dataset and scripts reside in their dedicated branches as listed below:

### 🐧 Linux Branch
- **Branch Link**: [linux_test](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/linux_test)
- **Description**: Contains scripts and analysis specifically designed to measure browser energy consumption on Linux-based operating systems.

### 🍎 macOS Branch
- **Branch Link**: [macos](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/macos)
- **Description**: Contains scripts, datasets, and analysis focused on browser energy measurement conducted on the macOS platform.

### 🪟 Windows Branch
- **Branch Link**: [windows](https://github.com/D4vidHuang/SSE_EnergyMeasurement/tree/windows)
- **Description**: Provides Windows-specific automation scripts, data, and detailed analysis for browser energy consumption studies.

### 📂 Branch Files Overview

**🪟 Windows Branch (`windows`):**
- `windows/` folder:
  - `benchmarks/`: Contains Python scripts for browser benchmarking.
  - `energibridge/`: The tool used for energy measurement.
  - `results/`: Stores output data from benchmark tests.
  - `benchmark_test.ps1`: Runs browser benchmark and energy measurement.
  - `sleep_test.ps1`: Executes energy measurement in sleep mode.

**🍎 macOS Branch (`macos`):**
- `macos_scripts/`:
  - `auto_script.sh`: Executes energy measurements by running all Python scripts in the folder.
  - `auto_sleep_script.sh`: Performs sleep-mode energy measurements.
- `results/`: Stores data generated by scripts.
- `img/`: Contains plots generated from data in the `results/` folder.

**🐧 Linux Branch (`linux_test`):**
- `linux_scripts/`: Contains Python scripts and Linux shell scripts for energy measurement.
- `release-energibridge/`: The energy measurement tool for Linux.
- `img/`: Includes plots generated from the measurement results.
